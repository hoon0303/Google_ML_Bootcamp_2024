# Kaggle Competitions

This is the repository for introducing the Kaggle competition.

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)  contains five courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The five courses titles are:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning.](https://github.com/hoon0303/Google_ML_Bootcamp_2024/tree/main/01%20Coursera/01%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.](https://github.com/hoon0303/Google_ML_Bootcamp_2024/tree/main/01%20Coursera/02%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects.](https://github.com/hoon0303/Google_ML_Bootcamp_2024/tree/main/01%20Coursera/03%20Structuring%20machine%20learning%20projects)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks.](https://github.com/hoon0303/Google_ML_Bootcamp_2024/tree/main/01%20Coursera/04%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
5. [Sequence Models.](https://github.com/hoon0303/Google_ML_Bootcamp_2024/tree/main/01%20Coursera/05%20Sequence%20Models)

This is by far the best course series on deep learning that I've taken. Enjoy!



## Specialization Certificate

At last I've successfully completed the specialization and earned my certificate!
