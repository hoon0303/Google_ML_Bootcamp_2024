# Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the forth course of the deep learning specialization at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) which is moderated by [DeepLearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/). The course is taught by Andrew Ng.

## Course summary

This course provides a comprehensive guide to building convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and applying them to image datal:

- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including modern variations like residual networks.
- Be equipped to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Learn how to use neural style transfer to generate artistic images.
- Gain the ability to apply these algorithms to various types of data, including images, videos, and other 2D or 3D formats.
