# Structuring Machine Learning Projects

This is the third course of the deep learning specialization at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) which is moderated by [DeepLearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/). The course is taught by Andrew Ng.

## Course summary

This course focuses on building successful machine learning projects and is ideal for those aspiring to become technical leaders in AI:

- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system.
- Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing errors.
- Gain insight into complex ML scenarios, including mismatched training/test sets and surpassing human-level performance.
- Learn how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.
